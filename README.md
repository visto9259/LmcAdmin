# LmcAdmin Module for Laminas Framework
Originally created by [Jurian Sluiman](http://juriansluiman.nl) and [Martin Shwalbe](https://github.com/Hounddog).

## Introduction
LmcAdmin is a minimal admin interface for generic administrative purposes. It is a common screen with navigation that hides behind authentication and authorization.

## Requirements

- PHP 8.1 or higher

## Installation
LmcAdmin is enabled to be installed via composer. 

```bash
$ composer require lm-commons/lmc-admin
```
Enable the module by adding `Lmc\Admin` key to your `application.config.php` or `modules.config.php` file. 

Customize the module by copy-pasting the `config/lmcadmin.global.php.dist` file to your `config/autoload` folder.

## Usage
LmcAdmin allows you to create routes under a single parent "lmcadmin" route. You can also use it to enable navigation in 
your admin layout. Furthermore, integration of [LmcRbacMvc](https://github.com/LM-Commons/LmcRbacMvc) is provided.

The complete configuration is flexible, so you can update the lmc_admin parent route, its children, the navigation 
and all default provided view scripts. Read more in the [documentation](https://lm-commons.github.io/LmcAdmin) about 
usage and customization of LmcAdmin.
